# Radiology Report Generation of CT Chest Scans - VLM3D Challenge 2025

The aim of this project is to generate a freeâ€‘text radiology report from a 3D chest CT volume. The radiology report:
- Correctly describes normal findings and pathologies
- Uses standard chest CT terminology
- Covers findings and impression

Radiologists spend considerable time dictating comprehensive reports for chest CT scans. Automating this step can:
- Speed up diagnostic workflows
- Reduce variability between readers
- Improve patient care by enabling rapid triage

## Architecure

This project is based on the **MedGemma** architecture, a specialized extension of the Gemma model family designed for medical applications. Explicitly, the large multi model version is used. 

For further architecture details, see https://deepmind.google/models/gemma/medgemma/


## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sonjabinder/ReportGenerationMedGemma.git
  cd ReportGenerationMedGemma
  ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
  .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
  ```

3. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt  # Linux/Mac
  py -m pip install -r requirements.txt       # Windows
  ```

4. Create a file `.env` and save your huggingface token with the required permissions for both MedGemma as well as the CT-RATE dataset in it with the following format 
  ```bash
  HF_TOKEN=<YOUR-HF-TOKEN>
  ```

## Usage

Note: The model was trained using an Nvidia A100 GPU with 80GB of memory. With less memory the training parameters need to be adjusted accordingly.

Train the model using the CT-RATE dataset:
```bash
python train.py [--samples 1500] [--images-per-sample 11] [--delete-sample-after-downloading] \
	[--model-folder "medgemma-finetuned"] [--optim "adamw_torch_fused"] [--epochs 20] [--learning-rate 0.00001] \
	[--train-batch-size 1] [--eval-batch-size 1] [--gradient-accumulation-steps 4] [--lora-alpha 16] \
	[--lora-rank 16] [--lora-dropout 0.05] [--target-modules "all-linear"] [--resume-from-checkpoint ""] \
	[--metric-for-best-model "bleu"] [--greater-is-better True] 
```

Test the model with validation samples from the CT-RATE dataset:
```bash
python eval.py [--samples 100] [--images-per-sample 11] [--delete-sample-after-downloading] \
	[--eval-batch-size 1] [--model-path "models/medgemma-finetuned/model"] \
	[--processor-path "models/medgemma-finetuned/processor"]
```

Predict unseen test samples from a local directory:
```bash
python predict.py [--images-per-sample 11] [--model-path "/opt/app/models/medgemma-finetuned/model"] \
	[--processor-path "/opt/app/models/medgemma-finetuned/processor"] [--output-file "/output/results.json"] \
	[--input-path "/input"] [--eval-batch-size 1]
```


## Docker

After training, the finetuned model can be containerized with the `docker/build.sh` script. The docker container uses the `predict.py` script as entrypoint. The `docker/export.sh` script saves the docker image in an archive for submission in the VLM3D challenge. `docker/test.sh` creates a new docker volume and mounts the exemplatory CT scan from the `docker/test` folder as an input image. The resulting report can be found in the `results.json` in the docker volume. This is used to test the docker container for correct functionality before submission on the VLM3D challenge.


## 3D-Image Example

<img width = "400" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6693b8be-6f44-43e1-8ebc-6de85009c34b" />


## Transform 3D-Image to ``n``x 2D-Images

At `N` points in the 3D-Image, the sagittal, coronal, and axial view is extracted. For each of the `N` points, the sagittal, coronal, and axial views are subsequently combined to yield `N` input images.

## Results

Across 1000 unseen CT scans from the CT-RATE dataset the following metrics are achieved with the finetuned model.
